eRPC is a fast and general-purpose RPC library for datacenter networks.
Our NSDI 2019 [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi19-kalia.pdf)
describes the system in detail.
[Documentation](https://erpc.io/docs/index.html) is available online.

Some highlights:
 * Multiple supported networks: Ethernet, InfiniBand, and RoCE
 * Low latency: 2.3 microseconds round-trip RPC latency with UDP over Ethernet
 * Performance for small 32-byte RPCs: ~10M RPCs/sec with one CPU core,
   60--80M RPCs/sec with one NIC.
 * Bandwidth for large RPC: 75 Gbps on one connection (one CPU core at server
   and client) for 8 MB RPCs
 * Scalability: 20000 RPC sessions per server
 * End-to-end congestion control that tolerates 100-way incasts
 * Nested RPCs, and long-running background RPCs
 * A port of [Raft](https://github.com/willemt/raft) as an example. Our 3-way
   replication latency is 5.3 microseconds with traditional UDP over Ethernet.

## Requirements
 * Toolchain: A C++11 compiler and CMake 2.8+
 * See `scripts/packages/` for required software packages for your distro.
 * The latest `rdma_core`, preferably installed from source
 * For non-Mellanox DPDK-compatible NICs, a system-wide installation from DPDK
   19.11.x LTS sources (i.e., `sudo make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
   DESTDIR=/usr`). Other DPDK versions are not supported.
 * NICs: Fast (10 GbE+) NICs are needed for good performance. eRPC works best
   with Mellanox Ethernet and InfiniBand NICs. Any DPDK-capable NICs
   also work well.
 * System configuration:
   * At least 1024 huge pages on every NUMA node, and unlimited SHM limits
   * On a machine with `n` eRPC processes, eRPC uses kernel UDP ports `{31850,
     ..., 31850 + n - 1}.` These ports should be open on the management
     network. See `scripts/firewalld/erpc_firewall.sh` for systems running
     `firewalld`.

## eRPC quickstart
 * Build and run the test suite:
   `cmake . -DPERF=OFF -DTRANSPORT=dpdk; make -j; sudo ctest`.
   * `DPERF=OFF` enables debugging, which greatly reduces performance. Set
     `DPERF=ON` for performance measurements.
   * Here, `dpdk` should be replaced with `infiniband` for InfiniBand NICs.
   * A machine with two ports is needed to run the unit tests if DPDK is chosen.
     Run `scripts/run-tests-dpdk.sh` instead of `ctest`.
 * Run the `hello_world` application:
   * `cd hello_world`
   * Edit the server and client hostnames in `common.h` 
   * Based on the transport that eRPC was compiled for, compile `hello_world`
     using `make dpdk`, or `make infiniband`.
   * Run `./server` at the server, and `./client` at the client
 * Generate the documentation: `doxygen`

## Supported bare-metal NICs:
 * Ethernet/UDP mode:
   * DPDK-enabled NICs: Use `DTRANSPORT=dpdk`
     * We have primarily tested Mellanox CX3--CX5 NICs.
   * DPDK-enabled NICs on Microsoft Azure: Use `-DTRANSPORT=dpdk -DAZURE=on`
 * RDMA (InfiniBand/RoCE) NICs: Use `DTRANSPORT=infiniband`. Add `DROCE=on`
   if using RoCE.

## Running eRPC over DPDK on Microsoft Azure VMs

  * eRPC works well on Azure VMs with accelerated networking.

  * Configure two Ubuntu 18.04 VMs as below. Use the same resource group and
    availability zone for both VMs.

    * Uncheck "Accelerated Networking" when launching each VM from the Azure
      portal (e.g., F32s-v2). For now, this VM should have just the control
      network (i.e., `eth0`) and `lo` interfaces.
    * Add a NIC to Azure via the Azure CLI: `az network nic create
      --resource-group <your resource group> --name <a name for the NIC>
      --vnet-name <name of the VMs' virtual network> --subnet default
      --accelerated-networking true --subscription <Azure subscription, if
      any> --location <the VM's availability zone>`
    * Stop the VM launched earlier, and attach the NIC created in the previous
      step to the VM (i.e., in "Networking" -> "Attach network interface").
    * Re-start the VM. It should have a new interface called `eth1`, which eRPC
      will use for DPDK traffic.

  * Prepare DPDK 19.11.5:
    * [rdma-core](https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core) must be installed
      from source. First, install its dependencies listed in rdma-core's README.
      Then, in the `rdma-core` directory:
       * `cmake .`
       * `sudo make install`
    * Install upstream pre-requisite libraries and modules:
       * `sudo apt install make cmake g++ gcc libnuma-dev libgflags-dev numactl`
       * `sudo modprobe ib_uverbs`
       * `sudo modprobe mlx4_ib`
    * Download the [DPDK 19.11.x LTS tarball](https://core.dpdk.org/download/) and
      extract it. Other DPDK versions are not supported.
    * Edit `config/common_base` by changing `CONFIG_RTE_IBVERBS_LINK_DLOPEN `, `CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MLX5_PMD` and
      `CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MLX4_PMD` to `y` instead of `n`.
    * Build and install DPDK: `sudo make install T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
      DESTDIR=/usr`

    * Create hugepages:
```
sudo bash -c "echo 2048 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages"
sudo mkdir /mnt/huge
sudo mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge
```

  * Build eRPC's library and latency benchmark:
```
cmake . -DTRANSPORT=dpdk -DAZURE=on
make
make latency
```

  * Create the file `scripts/autorun_process_file` like below. Here, do not use
    the IP addresses of the accelerated NIC (i.e., not of `eth1`).
```
<Public IPv4 address of VM #1> 31850 0
<Public IPv4 address of VM #2> 31850 0
```

  * Run the eRPC application (the latency benchmark by default):
    * At VM #1: `./scripts/do.sh 0 0`
    * At VM #2: `./scripts/do.sh 1 0`


## Configuring and running the provided benchmarks
 * The `apps` directory contains a suite of benchmarks and examples. The
   instructions below are for this suite of applications. eRPC can also be
   simply linked as a library instead (see `hello_world/` for an example).
 * To build an application, create `scripts/autorun_app_file` and change its
   contents to one of the available directory names in `apps/`. See
   `scripts/example_autorun_app_file` for an example. Then generate a
   Makefile using `cmake . -DTRANSPORT=dpdk/infiniband`. 
 * Each application directory in `apps/` contains a config file
   that must specify all flags defined in `apps/apps_common.h`. For example,
   `num_processes` specifies the total number of eRPC processes in the cluster.
 * The URIs of eRPC processes in the cluster are specified in
   `scripts/autorun_process_file`. Each line in this file must be
   `<hostname> <management udp port> <numa_node>`.
 * Run `scripts/do.sh` for each process:
   * With single-CPU machines: `num_processes` machines are needed.
     Run `scripts/do.sh <i> 0` on machine `i` in `{0, ..., num_processes - 1}`.
   * With dual-CPU machines: `num_machines = ceil(num_processes / 2)` machines
     are needed. Run `scripts/do.sh <i> <i % 2>` on machine i in
     `{0, ..., num_machines - 1}`.
 * To automatically run an application at all processes in
   `scripts/autorun_process_file`, run `scripts/run-all.sh`. For some
   applications, statistics generated in a run can be collected and processed
   using `scripts/proc-out.sh`.
